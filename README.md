### Hi, I'm Ben.

- 🌱 I am currently gaining further experience volunteering in a remote team via GitLab using React Bootstrap, Redux-Toolkit & Django.
- :zap: In my spare time I'm diving into Next.js, Redis, and other tech on a personal Thoughtstorm® Log project.
- 🛠️ Earlier this year I had some epic remote bootcamp experience building in teams with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React, Redux, ChakraUI, NodeJS, ExpressJS, KnexJS & SQLite
- :revolving_hearts: Decade of real world community experience working effectively in teams, giving and receiving feedback, and understanding client needs.
